# Quantified Self API (Rails)
This is a Rails-based API whose ostensible purpose is to interface with the [Quantified Self Front End](http://quantified-self.surge.sh), which is a calorie tracking application.

The Quantified Self API also allows a user or application to post and consume data for foods and meals, and is currently hosted on AWS at http://quantified-self-rails-dev.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/.  

 Local setup instructions and information regarding each of the available endpoints, are detailed below.
